    &lt;p&gt;CHAPTER I&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Of the imitation of Christ, and of contempt of the world and all its vanities&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. He that follows me shall not walk in darkness, says the Lord. There are the words of Christ; and they teach us how far we must imitate His life and character, if we seek true illumination, and deliverance from all blindness of heart. Let it be our most earnest study, therefore, to dwell upon the life of Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Above is an excerpt from The Imitation of Christ by Thomas A. Kempis, the first paragraph of chapter 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/Imitating-Christ-teaser.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
 “Christ teaches us how far we must imitate His life and character,” asserts the author of Imitation of Christ. The author assumes that we can imitate Jesus, and it appears quite a few folks agree with him. But as far as my study of Scriptures has brought me, the idea of imitating Jesus, or him being an example, goes against the biblical message as a whole. I was motivated to write this article after reading an introduction to the gospel of Matthew from a new Vietnamese translation, in which the author, or authors, referred to Jesus as the supreme teacher who had the authority to interprete God’s Law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;who-do-you-say-jesus-is&quot;&gt;Who do you say Jesus is?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People during Jesus’ time thought of him as a teacher. He performed miracles, turned water into wine, claimed to be the Son of God, but ultimately He was their teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Matthew 19:16-22, a rich young man came to see Jesus asking Him this: &lt;em&gt;“Good &lt;strong&gt;Teacher&lt;/strong&gt;, what &lt;strong&gt;good&lt;/strong&gt; thing shall I &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; that I may have eternal life?”&lt;/em&gt; This young man’s question succinctly represents the world’s view of Jesus considering the bolded words in his question. Obviously he considered Jesus a teacher who tells him what good things he must do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 3, we read of Nicodemus, a member of the Jewish ruling council, who came to meet Jesus one night saying: &lt;em&gt;“Rabbi, we know that you are a &lt;strong&gt;teacher&lt;/strong&gt; who has come from God. For no one could perform the miraculous signs that you do unless God is with him.”&lt;/em&gt; And Jesus responded with: &lt;em&gt;“I tell you the solemn truth, unless a person is born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.”&lt;/em&gt; Nicodemus had a hard time getting the meaning of being born from above because he could only see it from the eyes of the flesh. Much like the young man in the earlier story, he saw Jesus as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In both these stories, there were nothing Jesus could teach them that they could do. Could the young man truly fulfill any of the commandments even if Jesus showed him how? Case in point is his love for his treasured possessions violates the very commandment of loving the Lord his God with all his heart. Could Nicodemus obey, or try to imitate Jesus, to “be born from above?” Not a chance. It took the universe forming creative power of God to perform such feat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each descendant of Eve, the sin nature manifests itself in a different way. The bottom line is there is nothing Jesus can teach us, and nothing we can learn from him, to rid ourselves of this nature that had fallen short of God’s glory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In John 6 we read that after Jesus performed the miracle of turning a few fish and loaves of bread into enough food for five thousand people, and of walking on water, they asked him: &lt;em&gt;&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;‘What must we do to accomplish the deeds God requires?’’ &lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus replied, ‘This is the deed God requires - to believe in the one whom he sent.’&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like Nicodemus and the rich young ruler, the people immediately think of their flesh as a means to carry out what they think is God’s work. They wanted the teacher to tell them what to do, God said He only wanted them to believe in the one He had sent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;teacher-vs-savior-and-lord&quot;&gt;Teacher vs. Savior and Lord&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the gospel of Matthew we read that one day Jesus asked His disciples who they thought he was, they answered: &lt;em&gt;“Some say John the Baptist; others say Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah or one of the prophets (Matthew 16:14).”&lt;/em&gt; Then He asked them directly who they thought He was, and Peter answered: &lt;em&gt;“You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God (Matthew 16:16).”&lt;/em&gt; Jesus uses Peter’s answer to confirm his role not as a prophet,or any human at any capacity, but as Savior and Lord: &lt;em&gt;“Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by flesh and blood, but by my Father in heaven (Matthew 16:17).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the viewpoint of the flesh, Jesus is a human in various capacities: teacher, prophet, healer, etc., but from a divine revelation, He’s Savior and Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;assuming-jesus-is-a-teacher&quot;&gt;Assuming Jesus is a teacher&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the sake of argument, let’s assume that Jesus came to be our teacher. What might he be teaching us? All the things pertaining to human relationships? Not at all, but only what pertains to the righteousness that restores us the right to become children of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What could he teach us concerning the righteousness we needed that required His death on the cross? He performed miracles to authenticate his being sent by the Father—can this be imitated? He was born without sin, lived above sin, and died as an unblemished Lamb of God to take away our sin—can this be duplicated? He forgave sins past, present, and future of all of mankind—Imitate this? He raised people from the dead—Anyone? He is Almighty God—Dare you try this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However someone might raise an objection that there were plenty we could learn from Him on this side of eternity, such as humility, self denial, long suffering, and many qualities espoused in books through the ages. Kempis’ book Imitation of Christ is one such book. But except for some who are outside the norm, most folks appear to be socially and morally functional and they already possess the knowledge of these fine qualities expressed in Kempis’ book as well as many other sources. The Son of God didn’t need to leave heaven to teach us these basic principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man already had the ability to tell good from evil since the Garden of Eden (Romans 2:14). For the Jews, God spelled it out on tablets of stone. The problem isn’t that mankind needs to be taught anything that they couldn’t have learned already, it’s that though they knew all these things, they simply couldn’t do it. The apostle Paul expressed this dilemma in the following verse:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;We know that the Law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do, I do not do. But what I hate, I do (Romans 7:14-15).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then shortly later Paul concludes with this observation:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin (Romans 7:25)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we carefully follow Paul’s line of reasoning we’d find that though Christ is the solution to the perpetual struggle, in setting us free from the guilt of sins, there exists the reality of the sin nature that is a slave to the law of sin, and this will continue as long as we’re still in this corruptible state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;these-books-point-us-in-the-wrong-direction&quot;&gt;These books point us in the wrong direction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s survey another nugget of gold from Kempis’ book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It is vanity then to seek after, and to trust in, the riches that shall perish. It is vanity, too, to covet honors, and to lift up ourselves on high. It is vanity to follow the desires of the flesh and be led by them, for this shall bring misery at the last. It is vanity to desire a long life, and to have little care for a good life. It is vanity to take thought only for the life which now is, and not to look forward to the things which shall be hereafter. It is vanity to love that which quickly passes away, and not to hasten where eternal joy abides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doesn’t it feel like a cross between Proverbs and Ecclesiastes? All this wisdom is already there in the pages of Scriptures, but again the problem is “what I want to do, I do not do.” As I recalled my earlier years in the Christian faith, I took in every thought in Imitation wholeheartedly, but the problem was I couldn’t put my finger on anything that would nudge me up one notch in the spirituality ladder. It felt like when I was sitting in a class that gave voice lessons and after hours had gone by, there was no breakthrough, I still couldn’t get that elusive high note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books like this gives the reader an illusion of getting somewhere without real changes even in the here and now, let alone eternity. They draw the readers deeper within themselves, round and round in circles while providing no escapes. I like the expression I learned from Bob George’s book “Growing in Grace,” if memory serves me correctly: morbid introspection. Through all this I realized I simply exchanged the books on existentialism, those I used to read before I became a Christian, for books dressed in Christianese with virtually the same content, words that came from the minds of philosophers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;faith-vs-learning-do-vs-done&quot;&gt;Faith vs. learning, do vs. done&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we may learn skills such as computer programming, music, photography, and countless number of skills that are useful in this world’s economy, and many teachers can help us get where we desire, we can’t count on using the same approach toward the kingdom of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was Nicodemus’ problem when he thought to be born again was to go back to his mother’s womb to start over again. Jesus explained to him that a product of human effort, no matter how well cloaked in spiritual piety, will produce flesh, it will not inherit the incorruptible (1 Corinthians 15:50), he must be born again by the Spirit of God, and the only instrument through which he could achieve this was faith in Christ, not through learning from even the most supreme of teachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tendency to walk by the flesh, to use it to live out the Christian faith, is exemplified by the Galatians where Paul denounced in no uncertain terms:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh? (Galatians 3:3—NASB)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To begin by the Spirit is to start from God’s grace with nothing to rely on but faith, and perfecting oneself by the flesh is to try to improve from being already good enough for heaven to something even better. It’s this idea that Paul calls foolish. If Christ’s death on the cross is enough to make us perfect so we may come boldly to the throne of grace, how can anyone improve on what He’s already done? And worse yet all the presumed improvements will be done through the strength of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take an example of someone who used to have an addiction to gambling, but since he came to Christ, the addiction was gone. This change though positive and it sure will save him from all the pain and suffering from the addiction, it does not make him any more sanctified than the day he received Christ into his heart. Christ did not come to save him from a multitude of sins, but to deliver him from the root of it all, his sin nature, the deliverance from the addiction is just a bonus just as Christ had promised in Matthew 6:33: &lt;em&gt;“Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.”&lt;/em&gt; All these things include the overcoming of that besetting sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all—how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us all things? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The believer received the gift of deliverance from the addiction along with the greatest gift of all: Christ. The receiving of this gift of deliverance does not make him any more holy, or sanctified, than the moment he received Christ into his heart. Henceforth his life’s focus should be on His Redeemer and not on the gift, or any gift for that matter. It’s the job of the claymaker to mold him into any shape he wishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Books such as Kempis’ Imitation of Christ are guilty of taking they eyes of Christians off of Christ and turn them inward into themselves. Instead of explaining what Christ had done on the cross, the height, depth, and breadth of God’s plan of salvation, and about the righteousness that is theirs through Christ and everything they need for godliness and contentment that is included with Him, they turn the believers’ eyes toward themselves trying to draw from wretchedness and fallen flesh something to impress God and other people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;C.S. Lewis vehemently denounced the very thought of thinking of Christ as a teacher when he wrote this in his book Mere Christianity:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I am trying here to prevent anyone from saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him [Jesus Christ]: ‘I’m ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don’t accept his claim to be God.’ That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic—on a level with a man who says he is a poached egg—or else he would be the Devil of hell. You must make your choice. Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut him up for fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon; or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God. &lt;strong&gt;But let us not come up with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that option open to us. He did not intend to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly agree with C.S. Lewis on that point. That was why when our Sunday School class read the introduction in the new translation of the Book of Matthew I was so taken aback and kept voicing my objection to such description of Jesus as a supreme teacher. Far be it from anyone who calls on the name of Jesus to think of Him as such.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;We’ve all heard of the Ten Commandments, but did you know that originally God gave His people a choice between the law and grace? When God brought the Isrealites out of Egypt, He bore them eagles’s wings. In other words, he delivered them by grace. But instead of being contented to live by His grace, they wanted to live by law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dr-mcgees-sermon&quot;&gt;Dr. McGee’s Sermon&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/law-vs-grace-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The excerpt in large print above is from the introduction to Dr. J. Vernon McGee’s wonderful sermon on Exodus 19:4-25 which I happened to catch on the radio on Sept 21, 2016. I must have heard this message from Dr. McGee over thirty years ago, once every year for more than a decade, but never really understood it. I came to this understanding of law vs. grace through a different path, but hearing again from Dr. McGee this time, on the date of its re-broadcast on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.oneplace.com/ministries/thru-the-bible-with-j-vernon-mcgee/listen/exodus-194-25-552552.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;September 21, 2016&lt;/a&gt;, is quite a heavenly gift. His sermon inspired me to write this article from my own reflections of what this passage means.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;delivered-on-eagles-wings&quot;&gt;Delivered on eagles’ wings&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt and how I lifted you on eagles’ wings and brought you to myself. (Exodus 19:4)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know what was the state of the Israelites in Egypt, they were slaves under the brutal rule of their masters with no hope in sight. And yet here they were, delivered on “eagles’ wings.” This reminds me of Isaiah 40:31 where those who &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;wait&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; upon the Lord will mount up with wings like eagles. This must have been the state of God’s people in Egypt, they were “waiting.” Or maybe they weren’t even waiting; after hundreds of years being slaves for generations in a foreign land, all their hope must have been lost. To wait is to still have some hope for something, therefore to these people whose last ray of hope was all but extinguished, what could they have been waiting for? Either way, waiting or not, they were at the end of their resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This reminder, before the unfolding of events that leads to the giving of the law, the Ten Commandments, that came from the Lord must have been for them not to forget that they did nothing to deserve the magnificent rescue, that it wasn’t anything from themselves that they could get credit for, either their physical or moral prowess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God insists time a time again that it’s &lt;em&gt;“Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-different-kind-of-test&quot;&gt;A different kind of test&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;And now, if you will diligently listen to me and keep my covenant, then you will be my special possession out of all the nations, for all the earth is mine, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;and you will be to me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation.’ These are the words that you (Moses) will speak to the Israelites.” (Exodus 19:5-6)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait a minute! Aren’t they already God’s special possession? We know that God already made a covenant with Abraham in Genesis 12:1-3 that He would bless him and all his descendants, and we know that Abraham was called righteous before God because he believed the Lord (Genesis 15:6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The covenant God made with Abraham was a covenant of faith, but this covenant that is coming down the mountain is altogether a different one that came with a condition that requires their diligent efforts. Why is God asking them now if they want to be His people as if they were not already His in the first place? What changed? No, nothing has changed. God is the same before, now, and forevermore, and He would never go back on His word (Hebrews 6:13-20). The only thing that could have changed was the people, either they didn’t believe God’s promise to their father Abraham, or they had never lived by the faith that was given them through Abraham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God wasn’t testing whether they would desire or be willing to keep the impending law written on tablets of stone, but whether they trust Him enough to cling to His promise to Abraham. It is this faith that pleases Him, not self aggrandizing law keeping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foolish-choice-that-they-made&quot;&gt;Foolish choice that they made&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses came and summoned the elders of Israel. He set before them all these words that the Lord had commanded him, &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;and all the people answered together, &lt;strong&gt;“All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/strong&gt; So Moses brought the words of the people back to the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; As observed from the passage above, either they didn’t believe, or forgot the covenant that God made with father Abraham, or they willingly exchange that faith based covenant to a law based one, they exchanged grace for law. Though the Lord reminded them that it was on eagles’ wings that He delivered them, they chose to forget it. Much like so many people today who call themselves by Christ’s name steadfastly refuse to walk by faith, because by the law they would have reasons to boast of their own righteousness (Ephesians 2:8-9; Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such foolishness! (Galatians 3:1-6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People often cites Jesus love command &lt;em&gt;“Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind”&lt;/em&gt; (Matthew 22:37) with such self confidence like the people in verse 8 above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s read an interaction between Jesus and a rich young man who came to ask Him how to have eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Now behold, one came and said to Him, “Good Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?” &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;So He said to him, “Why do you call Me good? No one is good but One, that is, God. But if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.” &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;He said to Him, “Which ones?” Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder,’ ‘You shall not commit adultery,’ ‘You shall not steal,’ ‘You shall not bear false witness,’ &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The young man said to Him, &lt;strong&gt;“All these things I have kept from my youth&lt;/strong&gt;. What do I still lack?”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me.” &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;But when the young man heard that saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. (Matthew 19:16-22)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The young man in this story committed fatal errors not unlike the Exodus people above when he answered Jesus: “All these things I have kept from my youth.” Really? There is no one under the sun that can keep even a single commandment, let alone keeping all of them, but Jesus knew what is in the heart of this young man and he used it to bring him to the place of admitting his failure: his possessions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The test the Lord presented to the Israelites at the foot of mount Sinai was not whether they’d be able to keep the commandments He was about to give them, but whether they would want to relate to Him in one of the following two ways both of which represent a faith-based relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They trusted the Lord enough to claim His covenant with Abraham (Genesis 12:1-3).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They acknowledge their inability to adhere to the law-based covenant which God was about to deliver and cry out for mercy instead, and pray to Him if they could continue to ride on eagles’ wings for the remainder of their lives. Those who come to God in this manner He would in no wise cast out (John 6:37).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reminding them of how He had delivered them out of Egypt on eagles’ wings, the Lord was extending to them His hand of mercy but sadly they responded like many gung-ho Christians today: “All that the Lord has commanded we will do!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-days-to-change-their-minds&quot;&gt;Three days to change their minds&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “I am going to come to you in a dense cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and so that they will always believe in you.” And Moses told the words of the people to the Lord (Exodus 19:9).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord said to Moses, “Go to the people and sanctify them today and tomorrow, and make them wash their clothes &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;and be ready for the third day, for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;You must set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Take heed to yourselves not to go up on the mountain nor touch its edge. Whoever touches the mountain will surely be put to death! &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;No hand will touch him—but he will surely be stoned or shot through, whether a beast or a human being; he must not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast they may go up on the mountain.”
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified the people, and they washed their clothes. &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;He said to the people, “Be ready for the third day. Do not go near your wives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord gave the people three days to prepare themselves for what is coming. What is He trying to convey to them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The dense cloud in which the Lord is descending shows He’s far from accessible to the people.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Boundaries were set for the people around the edge of the mountain where violators, be they men or beasts, will be stoned or shot through with arrows to death. Once again the inaccessibility of God is affirmed, and &lt;em&gt;“flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable”&lt;/em&gt; (1 Corinthians 15:50)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even with all these preparations, being sanctified by Moses in whatever shape or form, clothes washed, sexual relations abstained, they could not see God. All that were just to prepare them for the third day; they were just ceremonially clean on the outside with no real change on their sin nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Should these three days facing the terrible mountain of God alarm them enough to beg God for a different condition in their relationship with Him? That they could continue to ride with Him on wings of eagles?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-forced-access-allowed&quot;&gt;No forced access allowed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;On the morning of the third day there were thunders and lightnings and a thick cloud on the mountain and a very loud trumpet blast, so that all the people in the camp trembled. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they took their stand at the foot of the mountain. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;Now Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the Lord had descended on it in fire. The smoke of it went up like the smoke of a kiln, and the whole mountain trembled greatly. &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;And as the sound of the trumpet grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him in thunder. &lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt;The Lord came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain. And the Lord called Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people, lest they break through to the Lord to look and many of them perish. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;Also let the priests who come near to the Lord consecrate themselves, lest the Lord break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;And Moses said to the Lord, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying, ‘Set limits around the mountain and consecrate it.’” &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;And the Lord said to him, “Go down, and come up bringing Aaron with you. But &lt;strong&gt;do not let the priests and the people break through to come up to the Lord&lt;/strong&gt;, lest he break out against them.” &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;So Moses went down to the people and told them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key idea in this passage is that the people, including the priests, are not allowed to “break through” to come near the Lord.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again &lt;em&gt;“It’s not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit”&lt;/em&gt; (Zechariah 4:6). God allows only one means of access to Him: through Christ, and our faith in Him. People forget that it’s the keeping of the law as means to draw near to God that offends Him, and their law keeping may manifest in ways that seem very spiritual: when they pray, when they give their offerings, when they do their good deeds. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALL THAT THE LORD HAD COMMANDED WE WILL DO!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Such foolishness that sent them back to the desert for 40 more years and most never made it to the promised land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;law-vs-grace&quot;&gt;Law vs. Grace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dr. McGee gave a list of contrasts between the law and grace:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law demands, grace gives&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do, grace says believe&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law exacts, grace bestows&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says work, grace says rest&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law threatens pronouncing a curse, grace entreats pronouncing a blessing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law says do and thou shalt live, grace says live and thou shalt do&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law condemns the best man, and grace saves the worst man&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The law reveals the character of God, and it also reveals the weakness of man&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is your choice?&lt;/p&gt;

    <summary type="text">We’ve all heard of the Ten Commandments, but did you know that originally God gave His people a choice between the law and grace? When God brought the Isrealites out of Egypt, He bore them eagles’s wings. In other words, he delivered them by grace. But instead of being contented to live by His grace, they wanted to live by law.</summary>

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-world-the-flesh-and-sin&quot;&gt;The world, the flesh, and sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/do-not-conform-teaser.png&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The general consensus is the world, whose definition we’ll explore later, is something negative that we must take care not to conform to its patterns. This negative something is generally accepted as sinful things that we must get rid of from our lives. The more of these sins we can get rid of, the closer we are to God. Oftentimes Hebrews 12:1 is brought into the picture to support the argument that we should make every effort to get rid of &lt;em&gt;“the sin that easily entangles.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A quick survey of all available commentaries reveals that they also hold the same interpretation, or perhaps they influence the rest of Christianity with their points of views? But people don’t really need commentaries to form this world view, all you need is take a survey of some of the major world’s religions, they all hold the same concept of sins and the need to deal with them in various ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All religions hold the belief that the flesh is basically sinful, a negative force that must be subdued or even annihilated if one hopes to achieve a higher state of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should not be a surprise to us that Christians, most if not almost all, also subscribe to this mode of thinking though it may be dressed in a more appropriate Christian language.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the one hand we’re exhorted to “love not the world” (1 John 2:15), on the other hand we must live in it, we share in this world the work we do to make a living, we drive on the same road, we go to the same movie theater, we watch the same TV broadcast, we traverse on the same Internet highway. Wouldn’t this internal conflict cause much trouble in a Christian’s life? Much morbid introspection that weighs heavily on the heart of the one who wants to do the right thing in accordance with their faith?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most commentaries are very long winded about what constitutes this “pattern of the world,” but to simplify the matter, the dividing line is between what is sinful and what is not, isn’t it? Then it logically follows that the command “do not conform to the patterns of this world” can be restated as simply as “do not sin anymore.” Does this make sense? Isn’t this what is implied in all sermons and writings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s difficult not to talk about the world without also calling into question the issue of sin. This is reflected in all the world’s religions, and Christianity is not exempted from it. Therefore if the question of not conforming to the patterns of the world is to be understood to be analogous to stop sinning, we may be better off taken from this world altogether.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;an-elusive-goal&quot;&gt;An elusive goal&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is it possible for anyone to be completely without sin?  The answer is easy right from the Bible itself, therefore if “do not conform” is to be understood in the conventional sense, we’re setting ourselves up for a lifetime of discouragement and hopelessness because the fact of our daily transgression will stare at us in the face on a continual basis. I read that Martin Luther used to take 6 hours per day to confess his sins, but I believe that had Luther, or the listening priest, had the strength, he would have had confessed all day long.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-christian-things-that-we-do&quot;&gt;The Christian things that we do&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though most pulpits do not preach it outright, virtually all pew sitters assume this is what they heard: worldly things are those not directly related to Bible study, church activities, ministries, evangelistic endeavors, prayer, etc. The way to please God is to &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; as many of these things as possible. We read in John 6:28-29 that upon hearing Jesus’ teaching, the crowd asked Him what the works of God were so that they could &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; them. People also asked Paul in Acts 16:30 about what they must &lt;strong&gt;do&lt;/strong&gt; to be saved. The same type of questions were posed to Jesus in the gospels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a lady in our church who works very hard to provide for her family with many sick people. Occasionally in our Sunday School class she would express her regret that she could not find time to do “God’s works.” I tried very hard to convince her that God’s works are those things she does when she works in her nail salon, when she cares for her sick husband and his sibblings, when she tries to catch a breath from between many responsibilities. In her mind these are “worldly things” that don’t count toward God’s kingdom. But it’s not just this lady who holds such a view of “the world,” it’s probably 99.99% of folks you sit next to every Sunday singing hymns of grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where does this understanding, or rather misunderstanding, come from? Where else but from the lack of sound teaching to ground the flocks in the absolute promise of salvation to those who call by Jesus’ name. Most messages I heard everywhere are about things Christians should or shouldn’t do. A disproptionate amount of communication is dedicated toward topics such as family, raising children, marriage, work, play, sex, and everything that is perceived as good under the sun. But all these things, as good as most of them are, are not in the exclusive domain of Christianity; they can all be found in non-Christian sources. Christ didn’t come to address these corruptible things. He came to address an issue buried deep in the nature of man. The focus on nonessential matter is the reason few Christians are grounded in the truth of how God saves us and accepts us in His Son Jesus Christ. And when Christians are not deeply rooted in Christ, false doctrine finds its fertile ground to grow like weeds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-romans-context&quot;&gt;The Romans context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you follow the logic of Romans from chapter 1 all the way to the passages preceding this problem concept of “do not conform to the patterns of this world,” you’d find the following key concepts:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul starts out by calling us into an obedience of faith, of believing in Christ, and as it is started with faith, it also ends with faith (Romans 1:17), or in other words: &lt;em&gt;“the just shall live by faith,”&lt;/em&gt; and this is contrary to the pattern of the world in that they live by “works,” by their performances, their human efforts to try to achieve a measure of spiritual perfection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then he continued on to show the Romans that unrepentance is the refusal to trust in Christ alone for their salvation (Romans 2:5), and the role of the law is contrary to what they think, it does not justify but instead condemns, and no one can through the works of the law achieve God’s righteousness (Romans 3:19-20). This reliance on the law to be justified before God is again the way, or the patterns, of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Paul continued for the remainder of Romans to show people points of contrast between the way of the world and the way of faith, one or human efforts and reliance on the law and one of faith in Christ, one of law and one of grace, one of merit projected from self to one of a gift received from God (Romans 5:15-19). The way of the world will lead to boasting because it is based on the principle of works (Romans 3:27-28).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then in chapter 8 Paul contrasts the seeking of righteousness through the law, which is a pattern of the world, as opposed to the righteousness through Christ (Romans 10:5-13).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-real-meaning&quot;&gt;The real meaning&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if we always keep in our sight the flow of thoughts that Paul presented from the beginning we’d have seen that “the patterns of the world” is not about philosophical differences between believers and unbelievers in their worldly pursuits, or of the sins they commit, but of the objects of their faith: who they trust to give them the righteousness they need to boldly come into God’s presence. The pattern of the world: works through the law vs. our pattern: grace through faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/resist-unto-blood.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #cccccc; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The gospel sounds very attractive especially for those who have embarked on a treadmill of religion with no hope of salvation in sight. They heard of Jesus&#39; promise of water that satisfies forever, of rest for the weary, of peace that passes understanding, and how He died on the cross one time for all the sins of mankind, they thought there in this wonderful religion is their hope. But once they got into the fold, after an initial honeymoon of joy unspeakable, somehow they found themselves back on the treadmill. They&#39;re confused but couldn&#39;t quite put their fingers on what is going on. The messages they heard from pulpits for decades seemed different from what they heard when they were still in the dark. They used to hear of the forgiveness of sins, now they keep hearing stern warning of sins that they must &quot;resist unto blood.&quot; It seemed to them the Christians haven&#39;t solved their sin problem.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than once during these years they’ve heard messages from Hebrews 12:1-4 which left them an impression that their troubles are far from over. Memories of that first love when they knelt at the cross are all but fading. Maybe God didn’t really forgive them at all. Though the number of times they heard sermons on this passage are few, they still served to magnify the giants in the promised land, to sow the seed of doubt and fear concerning their eternal destiny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a great cloud of witnesses, &lt;u&gt;we must get rid of every weight and the sin that clings so closely&lt;/u&gt;, and run with endurance the race set out for us,  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;keeping our eyes fixed on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith. For the joy set out for him he endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has taken his seat at the right hand of the throne of God. &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Think of him who endured such opposition against himself by sinners, so that you may not grow weary in your souls and give up.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin&lt;/u&gt; (Hebrews 12:2-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sin-that-easily-entangles&quot;&gt;The sin that easily entangles&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The underlined parts of these verses appear to confirm the common interpretation that we must make every effort to banish sins from our lives in order to run the race that is laid out before us. It makes sense, doesn’t it? It makes a lot of sense that a race runner must eliminate anything that can potentially affect his performance. Therefore in a Christian race, sin is a major obstacle that must be dealt with in every aspect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is the sin that easily entangles? Are they the sins that people commonly fall into, or some special sin—singular? We must go back to the beginning of this Hebrews letter where the author established the framework for us to determine what this sin really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier in chapter 2, the author warns believer of the risk of drifting away. This gives us a clue as to what we should look for in determining what we might be drifting away from, or toward. There are more signposts all pointing to the main truth that the Hebrews author tries to point us to, and of course they also point us to what is not, but perhaps addressing just these two main topics, the sin that easily entangles, and the drifting away is sufficient for the purpose of this article. Now let us consider next the concept of drifting away.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-danger-of-drifting-away&quot;&gt;The danger of drifting away&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore we must pay closer attention to &lt;strong&gt;what we have heard&lt;/strong&gt;, so that we do not &lt;strong&gt;drift away&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For if the &lt;strong&gt;message spoken through angels&lt;/strong&gt; proved to be so firm that every violation or disobedience received its just penalty,  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;how will we escape if we &lt;strong&gt;neglect such a great salvation&lt;/strong&gt;? It was first communicated through the Lord and was confirmed to us by those who heard him,  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;while God confirmed their witness with signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will (Hebrews 2:1-4).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most Christians believe that they have drifted away when work pressure, family needs, health issues, or whatever personal reasons cause them to miss church, to be unavailable for church ministries, or their falling into certain lifestyle causes much pain to themselves and others, to the point they wonder if they’re saved at all. They feel they might drift away if they don’t join every prayer meeting, if they don’t drop a substantial amount in the offering plate when a missionary came fundraising at their church, and myriad other things that they deem important to keep them on the straight and narrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But whatever this drifting away is, it must not be one of those things mentioned above, because there is a tone of utmost urgency in verse 3: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;“how will we escape?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; If it is, no Christian will escape because we all will fall into one of these things that rightly or wrongly creates a fear of falling away in our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s method of salvation cannot be something that is based on a shifting foundation. If He gives man &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one way to be saved&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, than their loss of salvation must be based on the failure to adhere to that &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;one way&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. But the message we get from most Christian sources seems much more complicated than that. According to these sources, though there is one way to be saved, there are thousands of ways one can drift away to our ultimate destruction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will resume at a point where we determine what we might drift away from, or toward. Without a clear identification of what it is, a whole ecosystem of how-to’s may evolve with lots of bandwidth wasted without any real help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-shedding-of-blood&quot;&gt;The shedding of blood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our natural tendency upon reading this part of the passage: &lt;em&gt;“You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin”&lt;/em&gt; is to think immediately of our battle against the lust of the flesh. But what does Hebrews say about bloodshed, its meaning and its purpose?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In chapter 9, after the writer of Hebrews describes the role of the priest who had to enter into the most holy place to offer the blood of bulls and goats for the peoples’ sins, he went on to compare such blood to the supremacy of the blood of Christ. The inferior blood of bulls and goats only provided ritual, or ceremonial, purity, but the blood of Christ can break down the barrier between the holy of holies and the profane world of fallen flesh to give man access to God. This it does by purifying their consciences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow sprinkled on those who are defiled consecrated them and provided ritual purity, &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our consciences from dead works to worship the living God (Hebrews 9:13-14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was the role of blood in this context be it of animals or of the Son of God? It is to give people the forgiveness they needed in their relationship with God, temporarily by one and eternally by the other. The blood of either one is for the purpose of forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore &lt;em&gt;“You have not yet resisted to the point of bloodshed in your struggle against sin”&lt;/em&gt; is not about struggling against sinful temptation, but about how you can pay for the sins that you have and will have committed. All men sin, the problem is how they can pay for them. In the Old Covenant, it was the bulls and goats that paid for them ceremonially, while in the New Covenant Christ paid for them now and forevermore. That is how He resists sin. Don’t you see Christ cannot be tempted because not only does He not have a sin nature, He is Almighty God. His purpose in shedding His own blood is entirely different from what contemporary pulpits try to apply to the controlling of the flesh. Additionally, we should have learned this already from the reason why the animals had to shed their blood: not for fighting against sinful temptations, but for the forgiveness of men’s sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think from this point on we can eliminate the shedding of blood from the equation. But the article cannot end here though its title is “Resist Unto Blood.” The application that is similarly derived from the concepts of “drifting away” and “the sin that easily entangles” still needs further treatment because their implication is profound.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;back-to-the-sin&quot;&gt;Back to “The Sin”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us ask ourselves again: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What is the sin that easily entangles?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; The question is not what are the sins (plural), but the sin (singular), that easily entangles. It’s one specific sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once upon a time when it is written in John 16:8 that Jesus describes the role of the Holy Spirit when he comes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he comes, he will prove the world to be in the wrong about sin … (John 16:8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How is the world wrong about sin? Well the world has been thinking that sin has to do with something bad that men do, or something good that they fail to do, how can they be wrong? Jesus continued:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… in regard to sin, because they do not believe in Me (John 16:8).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though someone may manage to never sin as everyone else did, he is in sin, because he came from a sinful lineage, but the moment he believed in Jesus, he’s delivered from sin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then years after Jesus had gone back to heaven leaving in man’s hand the ministry of reconciliation, God gave the Hebrews writer the task of reminding man once again the meaning of sin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;And to whom did He swear that they would never enter His rest? Was it not to those who disobeyed? &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;So we see that it was because of their unbelief that they were unable to enter (Hebrews 3:18-19).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God’s rest is the place where sins are forgiven, where man with unveiled faces can be in God’s presense without shame, where man can relate to God as Abba, Father. The Hebrews writer reminded his audience of the time when God’s people arrived at the Jordan river, all they needed to do were to obey God’s command to cross the Jordan to enter the promised land. Instead of believing God’s promise to bring them to the promised land, instead of listening to Joshua and Caleb, they chose to listen to the ten other spies who reported giants in the land. This was their disobedience, this was their unbelief that prompted God’s anger when He swore that &lt;em&gt;“they would never enter His rest.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again here the Hebrews writer reaffirmed what Jesus said concerning sin: UNBELIEF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is the sin that easily entangles. That is the sin that causes so many folks to not believing in Jesus’ promise of salvation to those who believe in Him. This is the sin that crops up from ministries that are supposed to reconcile men to God but instead caused them to further drift from God, when they proved themselves wrong concerning sin by focusing all their energy in fighting a wrong battle, when they focus on the sins (plural) instead of helping folks to firmly believe in the one that God had sent (John 6:29).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-drift-away-&quot;&gt;The drift away …&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us revisit Hebrews 2:1 which says: &lt;em&gt;“Therefore we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, so that we do not drift away.”&lt;/em&gt; What had they heard? What but the simple truth that the ultimate sin is the sin of unbelief? Didn’t they hear that those who have the Son have eternal life (1 John 5:2)? Didn’t they remember what happened to those who didn’t cross the Jordan to enter the promise land because of their unbelief? Didn’t they remember what Jesus said when He still walked among them saying the real sin is the sin of not believing in Him (John 16:8)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t drift away from that simple but everlasting truth: Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Don’t add anything to it, and don’t take anything away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The shedding of blood has nothing to do with battling against the flesh, but it has to do with the forgiveness of sin that only Jesus can provide. The shedding of blood is not something that you’re allowed to do; only the unblemished bulls or goats of the Old Covenant could, and only the Son of God could in the New Covenant. Who are you to try to shed your own blood?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sin that easily entangles is the sin of unbelief, of not putting your full trust of your salvation in Christ’s finished work on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And don’t drift away from that simple but glorious truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surrender. Rest. Peace. Letting go. But if the Bible says that the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, then how can you surrender to God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-dilemma&quot;&gt;The dilemma&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/images/surrender.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 1px solid #666666; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
All Christians experience to a varying degree great conflicts between their desire to do the will of God and their inability to do so. The theme Surrender is well visited by various authors through the ages from both Christian and secular sources. To the Christians the ability to surrender means many things; from being able to say no to temptations, to being obedient to what one might deem as the will of God in their lives, to being able to overcome many character flaws that had plagued them since the time their need for a deliverance nudged them toward the place of trust in God.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul not only described these struggles in the two letters he wrote to the Galatians and the Romans, he also showed us how we may find a solution. The goal of this article is to show that though it is indeed a very desirable and profitable thing to surrender to God, it is never intended to be a goal to be achieved, but instead it is realized by the believers as a byproduct, a fruit, of a much more important thing, a change in mindset, or outlook, in how we walk with God, from law-based obedience to grace-based empowerment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-to-the-galatians&quot;&gt;Paul to the Galatians&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul declared a statement of the fact concerning the reality of the flesh in our lives:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh: and these are contrary the one to the other: so that &lt;u&gt;ye cannot do the things that ye would&lt;/u&gt; (Galatians 5:17).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this verse we clearly read that our flesh’s desire is not the things of God, so it will not voluntarily surrender to God, and the end result is &lt;em&gt;“ye cannot do the things that ye would.”&lt;/em&gt; But most Christians think otherwise, that they can somehow muster the strength to do the things Paul said they couldn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul wrote this as a statement of fact, without exception, which will be further reinforced when we next study the following Romans passage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;paul-to-the-romans&quot;&gt;Paul to the Romans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do … &lt;sup&gt;21&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;So I find this law at work&lt;/u&gt;: Although I want to do good, evil is right there with me. &lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;For in my inner being I delight in God’s law; &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;but I see another law at work in me, waging war against the law of my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin at work within me. &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is subject to death? &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;u&gt;So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin&lt;/u&gt; (Romans 7:15,21-25).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul again describes the same thing he does in Galatians, but here he calls it a law, and a law is just what it is, it cannot fail, like the law of gravity, or other laws that describes the universe. But here Paul goes further to explain why this is the case. The reason being we are made up of two parts: 1) the inner being, the spirit, or the mind, and 2) the flesh, and they are in constant struggle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 25 appears to show us a resolution to the conflict, with presumably the flesh to be on the losing side when it wrote: &lt;em&gt;“Thanks be to God, who delivers me through Jesus Christ our Lord!”&lt;/em&gt; But is this really the case? No, this is not the case at all, because if we continue to read to the second part we’d find the opposite to be true, where Paul confirmed the reality of the existence of our two parts side by side: the flesh and the spirit, when he wrote: &lt;em&gt;“So then, I myself in my mind am a slave to God’s law, but in my sinful nature a slave to the law of sin.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our mind, or our spirit, the part that comes alive when we received Christ and the Holy Spirit as a seal of our redemption, loves and obey the law of God. This part does not have any trouble in such a way that it needs to surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While our flesh, our sinful nature, is a slave to the law of sin. Notice the use of the term SLAVE, which suggests a total submission to this law which makes resistance to it an impossibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul reiterates the inability of the flesh to submit to God later in Romans 8 as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For those who live according to the flesh have their outlook shaped by the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit have their outlook shaped by the things of the Spirit.  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;For the outlook of the flesh is death, but the outlook of the Spirit is life and peace,  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;because the outlook of the flesh is hostile to God, for it &lt;u&gt;does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so&lt;/u&gt; (Romans 8:5-7—NET).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we read that besides the fact that the flesh does not submit to the law of God, it’s unable to do so even if it does desire it. There is a very thorough discussion of the “outlook of the flesh” in the article &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/bible-topics/meditations/put-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;“&lt;u&gt;Mortify the Deeds of the Flesh&lt;/u&gt;”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which helps us see a more harmful aspect of the flesh not as instrument for sins, but as instrument for righteouness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;to-put-jesus-in-control&quot;&gt;To put Jesus in control?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can put this question another way: Can you surrender to God? Here the old hymn “Fully Surrender” came to mind with the following lyrics:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fully surrendered—Lord, I would be,&lt;br /&gt;
Fully surrendered, dear Lord, to Thee.&lt;br /&gt;
All on the altar laid,&lt;br /&gt;
Surrender fully made,&lt;br /&gt;
Thou hast my ransom paid;&lt;br /&gt;
I yield to Thee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The hymn suggests a willingness, and a decision is made, by the surrendering person to submit to God. But what did Paul write about the flesh? We learned from the Galatians and Romans passages that the flesh will not, and cannot, submit to the law of God. So if we apply Paul’s reasoning to the hymn, though its author may want to surrender to God, his or her flesh &lt;em&gt;“does not submit to the law of God, nor is it able to do so.”&lt;/em&gt; This hymn reflects the sentiment of the majority of Christians who are tired of the constant struggles and simply want to lay down and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The apostle Paul suggests we do not try to control the flesh, but to walk in the Spirit. We overcome the flesh by not doing battle with it, by not focusing on putting it under submission, but to walk in the Spirit. It will become clearer as we enter the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;walk-in-the-spirit&quot;&gt;Walk in the Spirit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hopefully it has become clear that the focus of ministries should NOT be on the taming of the uncontrollable flesh because the volume of truth we’ve read has shown the futility of doing so. Let us expand the context surrounding Galatians 5:17 to see the solution fo the problem of surrender.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;So I say, &lt;u&gt;walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;For the flesh desires what is contrary to the Spirit, and the Spirit what is contrary to the flesh. They are in conflict with each other, so that you are not to do whateverc you want. &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;But &lt;u&gt;if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law&lt;/u&gt; (Galatians 5:16-18).`&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here Paul shows us how to NOT gratify the desires of the flesh, or in other words to achieve a state of surrender, by walking by the spirit instead of doing battle with the flesh which will not submit to the law of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what does it mean to walk by the spirit? To pray all the time? To consciously put oneself in God’s presence? Read more Bible? Practicing God’s Presence?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What motivates someone to wish for a state of surrender? Isn’t it because of the constant struggle against what that they hate but end up doing anyway because the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is still one more important point that we can easily miss in verse 18: &lt;em&gt;“But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.”&lt;/em&gt; It is the law that amplifies the struggle with the flesh, just like it is written in 1 Corinthians 15:56 which says &lt;em&gt;“the power of sin is the law.”&lt;/em&gt; When someone lives under the law, there is a need to control the flesh, to put it into submission, to make it do the impossible: to submit to the law of God. Verse 18 shows us that it’s the law that puts one in this constant struggle, but you can be set free from the law by walking in the Spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here we must ask ourselves what is the role of the Holy Spirit in our relationship with God? Jesus describes the role of the Holy Spirit as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;And when he comes, he will prove the world wrong concerning sin and righteousness and judgment – &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;u&gt;concerning sin, because they do not believe in me&lt;/u&gt;; (John 16:8-9)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus made it simple for us to understand the true meaning of sin, of what separates us from God. So in explaining the role of the Holy Spirit, Jesus shows us that sin is the act of not believing in Him; when someone places their trust in Christ, sin is no longer an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When one walks according to God’s new law: the law of the spirit of life, which says he who believes on the Son will have eternal life (John 3:36), one experiences a rest from the never ending treadmill of performance where a sense of surrender comes without effort, like a child resting in its mother’s arms. That is how we walk by the spirit. That is how we surrender; not by struggling against flesh and blood (Ephesians 6:12), but by faith, by trusting in Christ’s finished work on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To surrender from a flesh-based perspective is a never-ending process which will not get one to the place of true yielding to God, but to walk by the Spirit is a once for all act of placing our trust in Christ: It’s Finished! If the world has been wrong concerning sin, it has also been wrong concerning their trying to surrender. Because sin is not about transgressions, but about unbelief in Christ, so it is with surrender, it is not about trying to overcome the flesh, but it’s about resting in the finished work of Christ. One is a never ending treadmill of repeated sacrifices, the other is a once-for-all act by the One who comes from God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/remain-in-sin.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
This article is a twin sibbling of the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/bible-topics/meditations/put-to-death-the-deeds-of-the-body/&quot;&gt;Mortify the deeds of the flesh&lt;/a&gt;&quot; article, it sets up the proper foundation for understanding the concept of sin presented here. Of all the key concepts that Martin Luther demanded that readers of Scriptures should grasp, &quot;sin&quot; is perhaps the most important.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!-- ##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase? &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;Absolutely not! How can we who died to sin still live in it? (Romans 6:1—NET)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day a friend shared something his young son asked upon reading a passage from a study bible. The study bible has a note that explains the meaning of “repentance.” It explains that repentance is a turning a way from sin and turn back to God. He saw a quiet concern in his son’s face. The boy knew the impossibility of achieving this repentance in all its full meaning. He’s more honest than many adults who might have read it without giving it much further thought for many reasons; maybe it’s nothing to worry about, maybe they think they have successfully turned away from sins, they sense no reason for distress even if this definition of repentance might turn out to be true.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The boy’s understanding of “sin” is representative of virtually every practicing Christian including one hundred percent of Bible commentaries I’ve surveyed on this topic. These commentators, who very likely reflect the Church’s understanding of the concept of sin, assume that the “sin” in Romans 6:1 is limited to a pattern of sin of certain degree of severity such as those spelled out in the Ten Commandments or others; therefore in this sense they can freely count themselves as not among the guilty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These men, the commentators, missed the very basic point of theology that even if they never commit any transgressions known to man, they are “in sin.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mankind-is-always-in-sin&quot;&gt;Mankind is always in sin&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Yet death reigned from Adam until Moses even over those who did not sin in the same way that Adam (who is a type of the coming one) transgressed (Romans 5:14).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Romans 5:14, the apostle Paul established the sinful condition of man: they cannot escape being in sin no matter how hard they try. The sinful condition is not from the sins that they committed or must repent from, it’s the body of death (Romans 7:24) that is inseparable from them until Christ comes again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If it is in fact man is perpetually in sin and it is impossible for them to get out of of such state, then why did Paul write in Romans 6:1 that they should not remain in sin? Do you see the contradiction? On the one hand they cannot escape sin, and on the other hand they must not remain in sin?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, such contradiction does indeed exist if one holds the view of sin like the boy as told earlier, or those of the well known Bible commentators. But for so long, Christians accept and live with such contradiction. The boy in our story knew better. He could feel there was something wrong in the study bible note that appeared to be as authoritative as the word of God itself. He saw the contradiction and it put him in distress. As a boy, he saw sin for what it was, no embellishment, no denial, no attempt to cover up with pious platitude. But most of us Christians are like the Pharisees, we see the specks in others but not the logs in our own eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-sacrifices&quot;&gt;The sacrifices&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mankind, the religious people, have always related to God through sin. To deal with sins they offered sacrifices, perform religious rituals, acts of penances, or whatever their religious beliefs dictate. The Jews of the Old Covenant had their own prescribed way to get relief for sins. The Christians of the New Covenant also came up with ways to deal with sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a perpetual cycle of sin and relief. They could see no other way to relate to God. It is sin that stands between them and their gods. Yet they could not get rid of it completely. Paul wrote these verses in Hebrews that beautifully express the dilemma of those who relate to God through their sin:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;completely unable&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;perfect those who come to worship&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;no further consciousness of sin&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year (Hebrews 10:1-3).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the law is “completely unable” to make the believers perfect, sin is everpresent between them and God; as a matter of fact, the sacrifices instead of fully erasing sin, they serve as “reminders” of it. It’s obvious in Paul’s writing that the ultimate goal of the believers is to have “no further consciousness of sin.” But nothing has enabled them to achieve this thus far. As long as there is the consciousness of sin in their minds, they cannot draw near to God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modern Christians mistakenly use 1 John 1:9 as means to eradicate sins, as if their confessions can be used to replace the Old Covenant sacrifices to be repeated over and over again. But even those sacrifices could neither get rid of their sins nor their guilt; the only thing that can accomplish such thing is the blood of Christ. The confession in 1 John 1:8-10 is a confession of faith, of their sinful condition and acknowledging Christ as Savior; it has nothing to do with sin and guilt offering under the Old Covenant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore under the Old Covenant system of sacrifices, or modern versions of penances, man “remain in sin” because the “consciousness of sin” remain in their minds and hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-cross&quot;&gt;The cross&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Subsequently in Romans 6:6-7, Paul explained how we can be set free from sin’s dominion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;We know that our &lt;u&gt;old man was crucified with him&lt;/u&gt; so that the body of sin would &lt;u&gt;no longer dominate us&lt;/u&gt;, so that we would &lt;u&gt;no longer be enslaved to sin&lt;/u&gt;. &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;(For someone who has died has been freed from sin) (Romans 6:6-7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to these verses, how were we freed from sin? Through “turning away from sin” like the note on repentance of the study bible? Through the natural view of sin in the eyes of a child? And the various Bible commentators? None of the above. Romans 6:6 says that it is through our old man being crucified with Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A slave cannot overcome his master, but must be set free. It’s the same way with our slavery to sin, we cannot wiggle ourselves out of it, no matter how much determination or will power one may possess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore though we did not physically get crucified, we inherit Christ’s crucifixion on the virtue of our faith in Him. It’s the same way we receive this gift of being set free from sin, or our no longer “remain in sin”, all thanks to what Christ had accomplished on the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as we still live in our body of flesh, we’ll never be completely free from sin, but our position in Christ has changed, our relationship with God has changed. It has changed from being condemned sinners to being children of God. Though the capacity for sinning is still there with us, we no longer relate to God through sin, but through the cross.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God gives us permission to lead a guilt-free life in our relationship with Him, in our salvation and eternal life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.  2 For the law of the life-giving Spirit in Christ Jesus has set you free from the law of sin and death (Romans 8:1-2).&lt;br /&gt;
As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed our transgressions from us (Psalms 103:12).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is why the apostle Paul wrote these great verses in Romans. To remind them that they had been set free from sin, and they don’t have to remain in the mindset, or the outlook, of being condemned sinners anymore. Now do we know what he really meant? He didn’t mean at all to ask why you still fall into this sin or that sin, but he meant why are you still walking scared like sin still has the power to put you under condemnation, why you still try to pay the ransom though it has already been paid for? Just like soldiers who came back from a long drawn out war still live with terrible memories. They came back to the free world but in their minds they’re still captives. So it is with many Christians who still came back to the place where they offered sacrifices for their sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You don’t have to remain in sin. Christ has set you free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-love-commandment&quot;&gt;The Love Commandment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/loving-God.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
The love command that Jesus uttered in Luke 10:27 has become a golden rule for virtually all variations of Bible based religions.  All other teachings from the Bible take a back seat to yield to this venerable command especially that it came from the lips of the Savior. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;!--##################### PLACEHOLDER ###################--&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;On one occasion an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “what must I do to inherit eternal life?” &lt;sup&gt;26&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;“What is written in the Law?&lt;/span&gt;” he replied. “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;How do you read it?&lt;/span&gt;” &lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;He answered, “ ‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind’; and, ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ ” &lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;“&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;You have answered correctly&lt;/span&gt;,” Jesus replied. “&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;Do this and you will live&lt;/span&gt;” (Luke 10:25-28).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus reminded his listeners of this command as it was recorded in Deuteronomy 6:5. Now He used it, He used the answer of the expert of the law, or perhaps what the man heard from Jesus in Matthew 22:37 to form his answer, to summarize the Ten Commandments which became even more powerful and encompassing than the original version as Moses received from mount Sinai. It penetrates deep into the heart and reveals sins no other commands can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chance-for-success&quot;&gt;Chance for success&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s go back to the Ten Commandments to reflect on how mankind has measured up to this Old Covenant’s golden standard. The Ten Commandments are just a more concrete version of the law that was written in the conscience of our first parents in the Garden of Eden. Mankind with or without the Ten Commandments had failed to keep even a single point of the law, and this is not to even mention what is written in James 2:10: &lt;em&gt;“For the one who obeys the whole law but fails in one point has become guilty of all of it.”&lt;/em&gt; Is there a living being that has never failed in at least one point of the law?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about the new golden rule, the love command? Jesus is supposed to make it harder for the religious people of His time to prove their own righteousness through the golden rule. He wants His hearer to stop raising their fists saying &lt;em&gt;“We are willing to do all the words that the LORD has said (Exodus 24:3)”&lt;/em&gt; but instead be on their knees acknowledge their failure and place their trust in Him. If they could not keep the Ten Commandments, what chance do they have of keeping the love command?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jesus used the love command to point out sin in the hearts of those who did not physically commit adultery, or murder anyone. The old commandment says: &lt;em&gt;“Thou shalt not commit murder,”&lt;/em&gt; the new commandment says: &lt;em&gt;“You must not commit murder in your heart.”&lt;/em&gt; The old commandment says: &lt;em&gt;“Thou shalt not commit adultery,”&lt;/em&gt; the new commandment says “You must not commit adultery in your heart.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, the love commandment is not the golden rule, it’s the new death sentence to all who try to get righteousness through it. The chance for success is not slim, but none.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-nature-of-man&quot;&gt;The nature of Man&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God (Romans 3:23)&lt;br /&gt;
Indeed, there is not a righteous man on earth who continually does good and who never sins (Ecclesiastes 7:20)&lt;br /&gt;
If we say we do not bear the guilt of sin, we are deceiving ourselves and the truth is not in us (1 John 1:8)&lt;br /&gt;
The human mind is more deceitful than anything else. It is incurably bad. Who can understand it? (Jeremiah 17:9)&lt;br /&gt;
It is not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners (Mark 2:17)&lt;br /&gt;
For from within the hearts of men come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery (Mark 7:21)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is there any chance man in such fallen condition can fulfill the love command? From the heart and mind that is “more deceitful than anything else?” But Jesus knew this already. He gave the command to stop man from deceiving himself, to get them off their pedestal, to realize that they are “wretched, pitiful, poor, blind and naked (Revelation 3:17).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-honesty-of-peter&quot;&gt;The honesty of Peter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Then when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  me more than these do?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; you.” Jesus told him, “Feed my lambs.” &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said a second time, “Simon, son of John, do you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; me?” He replied, “Yes, Lord, you know I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; you.” Jesus told him, “Shepherd my sheep.” &lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;Jesus said a third time, “Simon, son of John, do you &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; me?” Peter was distressed that Jesus asked him a third time, “Do you &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; me?” and said, “Lord, you know everything. You know that I &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; you.” Jesus replied, “Feed my sheep.” (John 21:15-17)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the words “love” in the passage above, one in bold and one in bold red. The one in bold red. The word &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #d30015;&quot;&gt;love&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; in bold red has the Strong number 25 for the Greek word &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, or agapáō, the same word that is used in the love commandment, while the word &lt;strong&gt;love&lt;/strong&gt; in bold black has the Strong number 5368 for the Greek word &lt;strong&gt;φιλέω&lt;/strong&gt;, or philéō, denoting a fondness between friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Jesus asked Peter for the third time whether he loved him, He came down to Peter’s level and used the word “philéō” instead. Peter never once used the word for “agapáō.” As gung-ho as anyone could be, Peter refused to commit to ἀγαπάω, or agapáō.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-love&quot;&gt;What is love?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The way Jesus asked Peter for the first two times whether he &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, or agapáō, him, is the same way He gave mankind the love commandment, to humble them, to make them realize that they’re mere man hence incapable of loving God with all their hearts, minds, and souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So God wrote in 1 John 4:10 to settle it once for all that love is not about man loving God, but it’s about God who is compassionate and merciful toward man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In this is love: not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins (1 John 4:10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s God who loves the world, and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life (John 3:16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Man inherently cannot love God. They think they can but in fact they love themselves. In saying they love God they elevate themselves to a higher level than they really are. They &lt;strong&gt;φιλέω&lt;/strong&gt;, or philéō, God but mistakenly think that they can &lt;strong&gt;ἀγαπάω&lt;/strong&gt;, or agapáō, Him. To fulfill the love commandment is to agapáō God, which is humanly impossible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thousands of books have been written on the topic of serving God. Those who seem to be doing something in some ministries believe that they’re serving God. Those who write books on serving God believe that they served God. What about the rest of those who are at the receiving ends of the various teachings, how do they know what to do?&lt;/p&gt;

So how do you serve God? Just the word &quot;serve&quot; itself implies something to do with spiritual things, or something in service of others, something that demands selfless devotion, that requires a certain level of personal sacrifice.
When we talk about someone serving God, we imply that their act of service is something self initiated. It is initiated by self because it requires some personal sacrifice. Most biographies are about people who engaged in these noble acts of serving God at great personal cost. The implication also is these folks deserve some types of rewards for their sacrifices.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- ##################### end FIRST PARAGRAPH ################### --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But is this concept of serving God consistence with what the Bible writes about the work done toward the Kingdom of God?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-biblical-meaning-of-serving-god&quot;&gt;The Biblical meaning of serving God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at Luke 17:7-10:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;“Would any one of you say to your slave who comes in from the field after plowing or shepherding sheep, ‘Come at once and sit down for a meal’? &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Won’t the master instead say to him, ‘Get my dinner ready, and make yourself ready to serve me while I eat and drink. Then you may eat and drink’? &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;He won’t thank the slave because he did what he was told, will he? &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;So you too, when you have done everything you were commanded to do, should say, ‘We are slaves undeserving of special praise; we have only done what was our duty.’” (Luke 17:7-10)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally we think of serving God as a voluntary and optional action. like serving a community by volunteering to work at a local food bank, or other non-profit organization. But here it appears the work involved is not the same, it’s neither voluntary nor optional, but it’s from a sense of duty, from a slave to his master. The work is expected of the slave. Therefore he’s not entitled to a reward, and of course not even a single praise. And since this work is required of the slave, it is not the same thing as a noble act of service we commonly refer to in church teaching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s study another example of service in the parable of the vineyard workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;“For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.  &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;And after agreeing with the workers for the standard wage, he sent them into his vineyard.  &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;When it was about nine o’clock in the morning, he went out again and saw others standing around in the marketplace without work.  &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He said to them, ‘You go into the vineyard too, and I will give you whatever is right.’  &lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;So they went. When he went out again about noon and three o’clock that afternoon, he did the same thing.  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;And about five o’clock that afternoon he went out and found others standing around, and said to them, ‘Why are you standing here all day without work?’  &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;They said to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’ He said to them, ‘You go and work in the vineyard too.’  &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;When it was evening the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, ‘Call the workers and give the pay starting with the last hired until the first.’  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;When those hired about five o’clock came, each received a full day’s pay.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;And when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more. But each one also received the standard wage.  &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;When they received it, they began to complain against the landowner,  &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;saying, ‘These last fellows worked one hour, and you have made them equal to us who bore the hardship and burning heat of the day.’  &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;And the landowner replied to one of them, ‘Friend, I am not treating you unfairly. Didn’t you agree with me to work for the standard wage?  &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Take what is yours and go. I want to give to this last man the same as I gave to you.  &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;Am I not permitted to do what I want with what belongs to me? Or are you envious because I am generous?’  &lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;So the last will be first, and the first last.” (Matthew 20:1-16)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since it is the same Jesus who told this parable as the one who told the story in Luke 17, we must think of these works as the same type: work a slave performed for his master. The way the vineyard owner pays the workers shows a consistency in this master/slave relationship. Equal pays mean neither rewards or praises toward the slaves. It’s probably not even a salary, because if it were, it would have been proportional to the amount of work performed. Then what is this payment for if it is none of these: reward, or salary? It’s probably for what they need for food, clothing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we were to combine both these stories into one, the meaning of serving God might be like this: there is no voluntary or optional service—because of the slave/master relationship, but there is one assigned to each according to the will of the Lord, and since it’s is not voluntary, there is no reward, or praise, or even a salary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A little clarification is needed here. Though we now relate to God through Christ as sons and daughters, the meaning of service remains the same if grace is the foundation of all areas of the Christian life. In order for the work or service to be grace based, it can neither be voluntary nor optional, but it is something God has already prepared for each person according to the riches of His grace. This puts all who might be in the service of the King, or even those who might not appear to be in any kind of service, to be on an equal footing. God will assign each one according to his great wisdom. This also make irrelevant the exhortation to serve God, because if God pre-ordain, and “impose” the work on his slave—a figure of speech, what need is there for exhortation? Can you not do the work that God has pre-ordained for you? Could Moses, Jonah, or Paul resist the work that God had planned for them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Might we then venture to say that voluntary, self-initiated work is not accepted at all in the kingdom of God? The answer to this question is key to understanding service, or ministries, or anything done in the name of Christ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;work-or-service-explained-through-grace&quot;&gt;Work, or service, explained through grace&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us review the familiar passage of Ephesians 2:8-10.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;it is not from works, so that no one can boast.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for good works that God prepared beforehand so we may do them (Ephesians 2:8-10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often stop short at verse 9, but verse 10 gives is a definition of service that comes as a result of God’s grace. The good works are prepared ahead of time by God to those are called on the basis of His grace. As it is said earlier, in order for the works to be grace based, it can neither be voluntary nor optional, so therefore there will be neither reward nor praises. This takes a way all reason for boasting of personal piety. The “imposing” of pre-ordained work on a believer is actually an amazing act of God’s grace, because it takes away the confusion of trying to figure out what one must do to serve God, but instead it gives one the peace of mind to wait upon God until He revealed to them what they must do. No exhortation needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;slave-to-righteousness&quot;&gt;Slave to righteousness&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is an amazing passage in Romans 6 where Paul used the imagery of slavery to show the transition from sin to righteousness which we may use to further explain that serving God is neither voluntary nor optional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;But thanks be to God that though you were slaves to sin, you obeyed from the heart that pattern of teaching you were entrusted to,  &lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;and having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness (Romans 6:17-18).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice the transition from slavery to sin to slavery to righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us talk about slavery to sin. Paul stated it as a matter of fact, that we were slaves to sin. In the slave/master relationship there is nothing optional, but everything is forcefully compelled upon the one at the receiving end, the slaves. Can a slave defy his master? No. Can a slave say to his master: Look, I’m serving you from the goodness of my heart, from my freedom to serve, not because I have to, but because I want to? No. Death will be the ultimate consequence if he does not do what is required of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul must have use the term “slavery” to show the irresistibility of good works that result from slavery to righteouness. Just as irresistible as sin is to the one enslaved to it, so is good works to the one who is enslaved to righteousness. We must understand that Paul is using this analogy to explain the irresistible power of grace in the lives of those who are in Christ to do good work. All this again removes the idea that good works done in the name of Christ are something initiated by self on a voluntary basis, where each person decides for himself what, where, when, and how to serve God. Absolutely not, the works are already prepared ahead of time by God from everlasting. No encouragement, nor any exhortation, needed. As a matter of fact, encouragement or exhortation from men may actually interfere or confuse the minds of the ones that God already had a plan for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Paul expressed this slave/master relationship in another way in Romans&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“For I do not do the good I want to do, but the evil I do not want to do–this I keep on doing.” (Romans 7:19)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-question-of-free-will&quot;&gt;The question of free will&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone may raise the issue of free will, to counter the argument raised by this writing, that the service unto God must be volitional and self-initiated for it to have any value. At first glance this appears to be a proper motivation to serve God, to serve Him from the freedom of grace instead of the conditional requirement of the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where things get very interesting. At this point we can define not two, but three, types of service: one based on free will, one based on the requirement of a law, and one proposed by this article that it is predetermined and ordained by God ahead of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The service that almost everyone embraces here is one that is volitional and self-initiated, it appears to be most noble and seems to be in accordance with the principle of salvation by grace and through faith. But is such service, though volitional, pure in motivation? Isn’t there the slightest hint of desire for praise or rewards?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one’s good work is completely free from even the slightest hint of selfish motivation. Jeremiah 17:9 says that the human heart is deceitful above all things. Isaiah spoke these words from God: &lt;em&gt;“All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away (Isaiah 64:6).”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore the only way for a service to count toward God’s kingdom is it must come from outside the person who performs the service so that rewards or praises on the basis of merit can be ruled out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you are saved through faith, and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God;  &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;it is not from works, so that &lt;u&gt;no one can boast&lt;/u&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;For we are his workmanship, having been created in Christ Jesus for &lt;u&gt;good works that God prepared beforehand&lt;/u&gt; so we may do them (Ephesians 2:8-10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romans 11:6 says that if any aspect of our relationship with God is by works then grace is no longer grace. Therefore boasting has no place in a grace-based relationship. No one works more than others because it is God who prepared the task for each person before hand. The “slave to righteousness (Romans 6:18)” concept though appears negative but it is the marvelous thing from the mind of God as part of the whole grace package. People are set free from the nagging question of whether they have done all they could to serve God. They rest in the all sufficiency of the Cross of Christ and trust that God already has a plan for each one to serve Him. In this sense, there is no need for “Serving God” as a topic for any book or sermon, except for one like this article which attempts to show that such topic is not needed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;External motivation, through liturature of exhortation, urging the reader or listener concerning serving God, may cause someone to leave their current station in life thinking that it is not considered an act of service to God. Furthermore if God has already prepared a work in advance for someone, will He not reveal to them so they have to try to figure out His mind like superstitious people? The way God revealed His plan to Moses, Jonah, and Paul is the same way He will also reveal it to us. The work of God is the task that someone is currently engaged in, their position in society, in their family, in a body of Christ. There is no need for anyone to tell them otherwise. If there is an encouragement or exhortation, it is for those who may be facing challenges in whatever task they’re currently undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all–how will he not also, along with him, graciously give us &lt;u&gt;all things&lt;/u&gt;? (Romans 8:32)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All things. Including serving God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words (Matthew 6:7). Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few (Ecclesiastes 5:2). Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, &quot;Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?&quot; (Job 38:1-2)”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/candle-prayer.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
Though this article is about prayer, its goal is to take the eyes of the one who prays away from himself, from the objects of his prayer, or even the technicalities, the how-to&#39;s of the prayer itself, and focus them on the Person to whom he prays.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a consensus that a good thing came about, someone was healed, found a job, disaster averted, because there was someone who prayed. In our house there is a wood carving which says “Prayer Changes Things.” Many books are written with annecdotes of miraculous things that happened because of prayers. These stories became the mountain peak of experience that seemed to endure much longer than the folks whose lives gave rise to such stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another assumption that seems to be prevalent in the mind of believers of almost any religions is their deity seems to be passive, or aloof, until invoked by the prayers of the faithful. Oftentimes the believers had to pray long and hard to move the hands of their divine being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;testimonies-on-the-power-of-prayer&quot;&gt;Testimonies on the power of prayer&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We often hear stories of parents praying for their children for decades until one day came the good news, the prodigals came home and all praises be to God. And recounts of groups of believers gathered together to pray for someone who had fallen down with some potentially terminal illness. And many more stories told and written through the ages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no doubt God heals and intervenes in the affairs of men, and He treasures the prayers of His saints, He felt every aching heart crying out for redemption, but does He have to wait until someone prays? God loves a sinner more than anyone who might know to pray for him, especially a sinner who has no one to pray for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abraham-lot-and-sodom&quot;&gt;Abraham, Lot, and Sodom&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis 18 and 19 recorded an event in which fire was sent from heaven to destroy the two great cities of biblical time: Sodom and Gomorrah. Special attention is paid to Sodom as it is the place of residence of the nephew of Lot. In this passage we find Abraham praying for Sodom in the way different than anything we often hear in praying circles. We aren’t here to study the form, but to study the unfolding of events leading to Abraham’s act of praying, as well as the content of his prayer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story starts out with the Lord’s monologue: &lt;em&gt;“Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do?”&lt;/em&gt; It was God who chose to reveal to Abraham his plan. Abraham was probably going about his daily routines with fleeting thoughts of when he and his beloved would have a child to continue his lineage. Though a child was born unto him through the maid servant Hagar, he and his wife were very likely wondering if God’s promise concerning a child of their own was still something to come though it had been a long time since they first heard it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up to this point, Abraham wasn’t praying about Sodom, and neither was he praying about his nephew Lot, at least not until the Lord revealed his plan to him. And even when he began to pray, his prayer is unlike anything you and I are familiar with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham didn’t pray about Lot. But upon hearing the Lord share his plan to destroy Sodom, he asked:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Will You indeed sweep away the righteous with the wicked? &lt;sup&gt;24&lt;/sup&gt;“Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed sweep it away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? &lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt;“Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth deal justly?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Lord answered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place on their account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then Abraham proceeded to see how far he can go in numbers of righteous before the Lord would destroy the city. Forty five righteous? Forty? Thirty? Twenty? And finally ten? To each the Lord answered that He wouldn’t destroy the city for their sake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-most-important-thing&quot;&gt;The most important thing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why didn’t Abraham pray specifically for his nephew Lot? Of course there were many important things in Abraham’s life, and Lot was among them (Genesis 13:8-9), but there was something infinitely more important: God’s character. As each question was asked with a decreased number of righteous, Abraham felt he knew the Lord a little more. To him, everything else, from Lot, to the city of Sodom, and even to the nagging question in his heart about a promised offspring, and the rest of worldly concerns, pales by comparison to the knowledge of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham had an expectation of what the God of the universe should be: “Far be it from You to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked.” Abraham didn’t need to go any further. For now he knew even with one righteous in the city, the Lord would spare it for the sake of one. That is the God that Abraham wanted to know, and to trust. He can trust Him with the fate of Lot and Sodom. From this point on, whatever happens he knew all is well. His world is safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;seek-first-the-kingdom-of-god&quot;&gt;Seek first the kingdom of God&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;So do not worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’ &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them. &lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt;But &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;seek first his kingdom and his righteousness&lt;/span&gt;, and all these things will be given to you as well. &lt;sup&gt;34&lt;/sup&gt;Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own (Matthew 6:31-34).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Seek first God’s kingdom and His righteousness. This was what we observed from Abraham’s conversation with God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surely Abraham is a man like us with many needs to be prayed for. We know he and his wife Sarah are still waiting for God’s promise to be fulfilled in their lives concerning a child. We also know he must be anxious about his nephew Lot and his family in Sodom. And then perhaps in their old age they might have some physical needs to be attended to. And other common worries of people of this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But we didn’t hear any reference to these things in Abraham’s prayer to God. Instead we heard him probing the depth of God’s love for those who belong to him. If Abraham could trust God on this matter, he could trust Him on everything else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham must have heard of Sodom’s reputation as a very sinful city. Yet he didn’t ask God to send fire down to destroy it. He chose instead to focus on the righteous, if any, who might dwell in the city. But his prayer is not just about saving the righteous, it’s about the character of God. How God answered Abraham’s series of questions will shape in his mind the image of God which in turn will affect his view of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham is truly a man who seeks first God’s kingdom and His righteousness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Abraham’s prayer also helps us understand 2 Peter 3:18 which says:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let Abraham’s prayer guide us in how we learn about God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;his-eye-is-on-the-sparrow&quot;&gt;His eye is on the sparrow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;29&lt;/sup&gt;Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground outside your Father’s care.[a] &lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt;And even the very hairs of your head are all numbered. &lt;sup&gt;31&lt;/sup&gt;So don’t be afraid; you are worth more than many sparrows (Matthew 10:29-31).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If God cares for each sparrow, or even something that seems as insignificant as a strand of hair on your head, wouldn’t he also care about important things in your life such as your health, your daily bread, or other concerns that may weigh heavily on your minds? How about things that appear to be spiritual such as ministries, evangelistic endeavors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God is not aloof, and neither does He slumber nor sleep. As in the case of Abraham concerning Sodom and his nephew Lot, it was God who brought the news to him. Abraham’s prayer was a response to God’s gracious wish to share with him what that he could not conceive in his limited understanding: “Shall I hide from Abraham what I’m about to do?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was also God who brought to Moses his plan to deliver His people from Egypt while the thoughts of Egypt and the people he once knew had long faded from his memory. Moses was now eighty years old and had been accustomed to a quiet life in the desert. No, he wasn’t praying for his still enslaved people, neither was there anyone around who shares his vision of delivering his people from Egypt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What about Jonah, was it him who loved the people of Nineveh, or was it God? Was it Jonah who had a great vision of evangelizing these people or was it God who revealed to him His heart: “For God so loved the world”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the same way with the apostle Paul. He was busy persecuting Christians when God revealed to him that he was to become instrumental in guiding them in the right path in their new found faith in Christ. As a matter of fact, Paul was already set apart by God in his mother’s womb for the work He already planned for him to do (Galatians 1:15), and this was long before Paul knew how to pray.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of these men took any initiative in these great undertakings. They simply carried on their lives the way they knew best, completely oblivious to the great events that were to take place later after they were brought into the service of the King of heaven.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are of course times we need to pray, and pray earnestly, for matters of great urgency. Though we know God already knew everything about us, our being able to share our burdens with God is a great blessing, especially when there is a promise that the Holy Spirit will help us express thoughts that otherwise might elude us in our times of need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But need we pray all the time? Imagine a child talking to his parents incessantly. Prayer is not just about talking to God, but it’s about listening as well. Consider listening to God as a an infinitely better form of prayer. And more often than not God speaks to us through Scriptures. Lastly, it’s better to be still and acknowledge that He is God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“And when you pray, do not keep on babbling like pagans, for they think they will be heard because of their many words (Matthew 6:7).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Do not be quick with your mouth, do not be hasty in your heart to utter anything before God. God is in heaven and you are on earth, so let your words be few (Ecclesiastes 5:2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said, “Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge?” (Job 38:1-2).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grace can be just a word to fill a part of a theology, or it can be something so precious that most are blind to it until when the eyes are opened to its wondrous life transforming power. A Christian whose root grows deep in the grace and knowledge of Christ (2 Peter 3:18) is still, and always has been, a rare breed, and yet here we’re talking about &quot;not abusing God’s grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/assets/images/break-the-chains.jpg&quot; style=&quot;border: 0px none; margin: 7px 15px 0px 0px; max-width: 100%; height: 148px; padding: 0px; float: left;&quot; /&gt;
There have been many sermons preached and books written on various subjects; but no matter what the titles are and however many angles from which they came, the underlying teaching is a focus on sins and the warnings against falling into them. More often than not, Romans 6:1 is used as the basis for such teaching: &lt;em&gt;&quot;What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is clearly an assumption that the majority of Christians needs to be reminded that they should not abuse God’s grace; this assumption is reflected in the amount of sermons and writings. This article attempts to show that such warnings are both misplaced and show perhaps a lack of the knowledge of God’s grace on the part of the writers or preachers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-false-assumption&quot;&gt;A false assumption&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do people really need to know God’s grace before they can start taking advantage of it? If it is true that people do take advantage of God’s grace, then the world may be better of without Christianity, because then they would not have known God’s grace to abuse it, or to find a license to sin. Of course we all know that people sinned long before they knew of the concept of God’s grace. Consider how much man sinned before God sent the great flood, and that was long before Christ came to freely give salvation to those who believed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve heard many testimonies and stories of changed lives, of those who led such lives controlled by sins and then changed for the better. If these testimonies are true, and if these positive stories of changed lives are reliable, then what is the rationale for such teaching? What necessitates the constant preaching against the abusing of God’s grace which defies the very guarantee of God that &lt;em&gt;“He who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus” (Philippians 1:6)&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-contradictions&quot;&gt;The contradictions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before the message of “Do not abuse God’s grace” should be widely preached, if it should ever be preached, the seed of faith must have been firmly planted in the hearts of listeners so that they became fully convicted that God’s forgiveness through the cross can cover their multitude of sins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before such state of faith can be established, there’s no point worrying about the abusing of God’s grace, because how can someone who does not have the assurance of salvation, the salvation that is by grace through faith, do the very thing they’re being accused of?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the book “The Grace Awakening,” Charles Swindoll asserted if you don’t preach grace until you’re accused of giving people a license to sin, you haven’t preached anything of great value at all. The great preacher Martyn L. Jones also expressed virtually the same idea years before C. Swindoll. But both these men simply recapitulated what the apostle Paul wrote in Romans of accusation against his preaching too much of God’s grace: &lt;em&gt;“What shall we say then? Are we to remain in sin so that grace may increase?”&lt;/em&gt;, to which he responded &lt;em&gt;“Absolutely not.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In reality, a survey of all material ever written through the ages shows a disproportionate focus on sins, not grace. Therefore we can safely assert that the “do not abuse God’s grace” type of preaching is not based on the true assessment of the believers’ faith at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, the glaring contradiction lies in the fact that little time is spent on preaching God’s grace, and yet much time is spent in warning against abusing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gods-grace-promotes-sin&quot;&gt;God’s grace promotes sin?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preaching of “do not abuse God’s grace” is only valid if God’s grace does in fact cause an increase in sins. But this is not what the Bible said. It said that the sinful passions were aroused by the law (Romans 7:5), not by God’s grace. It is the misdirected focus on sin that puts people in a downward spiral. The more they try to avoid sin, the more they’re drawn to it like a dog returning to its vomit (Proverbs 26:11).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 1 Corinthians 15:56 Paul states in no uncertain term that the power of sin is the law. This is quite an unexpected thing to most students of the Bible; because they will almost always resort to using the law to restrain the flesh, but in reality it produces the opposite effect, it arouses the sinful passion of the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us revisit Romans 7:5 in a slightly larger context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;For when we were in the flesh, &lt;u&gt;the sinful desires, aroused by the law&lt;/u&gt;, were active in the members of our body to &lt;u&gt;bear fruit for death&lt;/u&gt;.  &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;But now we have been &lt;u&gt;released from the law&lt;/u&gt;, because we have died to what controlled us, so that we may &lt;u&gt;serve in the new life of the Spirit&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;not under the old written code&lt;/u&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We read from these verses a study in contrast, on one side we have the law and its deadly fruit, on the other we have its opposite, grace, and though its fruit is not mentioned, we know it must produce fruit for life. We used to be under the control of the law, now we are released from the law. We have died to what controlled us—namely the law, the old written code—, now we live in the new life of the Spirit. And finally, in order to serve in the new life of the Spirit, we must have died to the law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therefore if our goal is to overcome the lust of the flesh, we actually needs God’s grace instead of warning againts it. It is the law that gives sin its power. It is the law that arouses the sinful passions in us. Not grace. Far be it from us to be leary of what is as beautiful as the grace of God.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;do-our-churchs-people-really-know-gods-grace&quot;&gt;Do our church’s people really know God’s grace?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated earlier in this writing, it doesn’t make sense to warn people of the danger of the abusing of God’s grace if they don’t have a full grasp of what it means. One practical question we must ask ourselves is: Do our church’s people really know God’s grace? How can we tell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t have to look further than the context of our own body of Christ. Very few churchgoers, even those who regularly attend Sunday Schools, are sure of their salvation. When asked whether they know where they’d be once this life is over, or when the Lord returns at the sound of the trumpet (I Corinthians 15:52), the answer is usually: “We can only try our best,” or something else of equal or even less certainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they had had a full knowledge of God’s grace they would have had no such doubt of their salvation. Their answers to the important question of their eternal place in the heavenly realm would have been more certain if not absolute, because this salvation is based not on human ability but on the promise of God. Therefore it makes no sense to warn them of the negative side of the dangerous “grace” if they had not possessed it in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-conclusion&quot;&gt;In conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preaching of “do not abuse God’s grace” is like a fly in the ointment. Jesus died on the cross to showcase God’s matchless grace to mankind, but it is man that attempts to put a lid on this bright light that gives hope to wretched sinners. Their message amounts to: God’s grace is amazing, but it has a dark side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Preachers of “Do not abuse God’s grace” should begin to trust in God, in the indwelling Holy Spirit who will take care of his own, who will continue His work of preparing them for the kingdom of God. They should instead make up their mind to only lead people to Christ and leave the work of transformation in the hands of the One who made living being out of inanimate clay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They should trust that if God had not put a leash on His grace, neither should they. But to be fair, God does put a leash, a different kind of leash, on His children: the Holy Spirit. He will shed His love—grace—abroad in their hearts, and this love will constrain us as it did the apostle Paul (2 Corinthians 5:14).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no “thou shalt not abuse God’s grace” teaching in the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
